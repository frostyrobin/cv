              <h3>Trading Stocks</h3>
              <p>I've been studying the markets and trading stocks for 5 years now. My interest in this subject began when I saw videos
                  of people doing technical analysis and I thought that's really cool since I really like connecting the dots and generating insights. Eventually, I learned to love economics and finance too.</p>

              <h3>Programming</h3>
              <p>My interest in this subject stems from my desire to automate and create things, but i've never gotten a consistent run at the subject. Turns out a pandemic is all it
              takes for me to get off my ass and start working on it. One of the things that I would want to achieve in this subject is to learn
                  artificial intelligence and create cool stuff with it (something like JARVIS).</p>

                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>Another subject that i've been interested in for a really long time but never gotten an opportunity to
                    learn is playing the piano. This pandemic is bad and all, but it still has bright spots.
                    For me, it has provided the opportunity to learn stuff that I really love!</p>
